# Observer World — living symbolic 3D island

**Current accepted public game: [Observer World V7, smartphone + desktop](https://mpaykin1.github.io/meta6/observer-world-en-v7/)**

**Owner verdict: PASS — 16 October 2026.** [Official success record](docs/SUCCESS_OBSERVER_WORLD_V7_MOBILE_2026-10-16.md) · [technical Chrome/WebGL success](https://github.com/mpaykin1/meta6/actions/runs/38896347402).

Observer World combines the original 3D *Island of Twilight* voxel environment, lighting, water, animated sprites, original sound/weapons and native Three.js camera with the historical symbol-building game. Choose a symbol; build a place; inhabitants, conflicts and narrative consequences follow.

Then open the [complete V7 handoff](observer-world-en-v7/CLAUDE.md) or the [source index for every edition](SOURCE_INDEX.md). The repository is **public**, so the source can be **read** in a new conversation without sending the HTML again; committing requires that agent's GitHub write authorization. Nothing automatically gives an unrelated AI session permissions to edit a GitHub account.

## Accepted mechanics

Mobile displays a joystick on the left; exactly three right buttons (combined attack/fire+jump, build and weapon change); bottom glyph bar; music/fullscreen in ☰. Select a glyph, touch a site by the character, then tap hammer to build. Native trees fall; original land works despite differing heights using a stone base, but occupied structures cannot be overwritten. Desktop keyboard/mouse controls remain unchanged.

**Protection of completed work:** V5 graphics PASS and V7 mobile PASS are accepted user baselines. Preserve these exact editions. Any substantial redesign should be in V8, a new branch, or a pull request, with a fresh user PASS/FAIL.

**Machine-readable index:** [game-source-index.json](game-source-index.json). [Prior editions and original HTML archives](SOURCE_INDEX.md).
